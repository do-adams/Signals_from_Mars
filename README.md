# Signals from Mars
An exercise in interactive storytelling.

![Signals from Mars](/Signals from Mars.png?raw=true)

A cool proof-of-concept Android app I built following through the [Build an Interactive Story App](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-an-interactive-story-app)
course at [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/). The app tells a futuristic, personalized space-explorer mini-story and 
engages the user with multiple endings.

It makes some pretty efficient use of resources given that the whole story is told using only two Activities.
Give it a look!
